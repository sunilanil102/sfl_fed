3) **Proposed Method / Algorithm  :**  An FMMC-based model consensus algorithm is proposed for DFL by formulating the problem of model consensus as an FMMC problem.
                                   The consensus matrix is optimized by taking the entire network topology into account to improve the efficiency of collaborative training and reduce the communication time. 
                                   Furthermore, a practical protocol with time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) scheduling policy is adopted to implement the proposed DFL approach.

                                       * Sum-weight gossip based consensus algorithms perform model aggregation according to the degree of a device. 
                                       * Laplacian-based constant consensus computes the aggregation weight according to the Laplacian matrix of the entire network.
