1) **Paper Title                  :**  Decentralized Federated Learning With Markov Chain Based Consensus for Industrial IoT Networks
2) **Published Journel & Year     :**  IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 4, APRIL 2023
3) **Proposed Method / Algorithm  :**  An FMMC-based model consensus algorithm is proposed for DFL by formulating the problem of model **consensus as an FMMC problem**.
                                   The consensus matrix is optimized by taking the entire network topology into account to improve the efficiency of collaborative training and reduce the communication time. 
                                   Furthermore, a practical protocol with time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) scheduling policy is adopted to implement the proposed DFL approach.
4) **Compared Approcahes          :**
   1. Metropolisâ€“Hastings
   2. Sum-weight gossip based consensus algorithms perform model aggregation according to the degree of a device.
   3. Laplacian-based constant consensus computes the aggregation weight according to the Laplacian matrix of the entire network.

# Third Paper is Matched with our Idea But It was not published yet to any other Journels
```
1) **Paper Title                  :**  OCD-FL: A Novel Communication-Efficient Peer Selection-based Decentralized Federated Learning
2) **Published Journel & Year     :**  ArXiv 2024
3) **Proposed Method / Algorithm  :**  The goal is to efficiently select neighbors for collaboration taking into account the **amount of energy required for transmission as well as the 
                                       knowledge gained by neighbors** as a result of the collaboration.
4) **Compared Approcahes          :**
   1. No Major Comparisons
